# AI Pakistan Project

Welcome to the AI Pakistan project! This repository contains a comprehensive website that showcases various machine learning models developed using Python and integrated into a Flask-based web application. The project focuses on providing multiple AI-based functionalities, including a face mask detector, emotion recognition, COVID-19 detector, an AI blog writer, an interactive chatbot, and user authentication.

## Features

1. **Face Mask Detector**: This feature employs machine learning to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The model has been trained to classify images accurately.

2. **Emotion Recognition**: The emotion recognition module identifies emotions in facial expressions. Leveraging machine learning, it can categorize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., from images.

3. **COVID-19 Detector**: This module predicts the likelihood of a person having COVID-19 based on provided symptoms. It uses machine learning techniques to make predictions.

4. **AI Blog Writer**: The AI blog writer generates human-like text content based on input prompts. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to produce coherent and relevant blog content.

5. **Interactive Chatbot**: The interactive chatbot engages users in real-time conversations. It employs Natural Language Processing to understand user inputs and provide appropriate responses.

6. **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to the website, enabling personalized experiences and access to specific functionalities.
